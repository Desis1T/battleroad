## Battleroad
Battleroad is the first brazilian eSports championship platform. It was made on top of Laravel framework and MySQL as database.

## Installing
I use Docker and Docker Compose to work on the platform. Checkout the `docker-compose.yml` to see the stack.
After installing the dependencies, run the `migrations` and `seeds` and you are good to start.

## Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing to the Battleroad platform! We have a lot of work to do and I appreciate any help you could give. Even updating this readme!
